        <p>Blend fresh raspberries with lime, mint, sugar, white rum and sparkling water to make a punchy raspberry mojito that's perfect for summer parties</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 raspberries</li>
            <li>1 lime, chopped into large chunks</li>
            <li>2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 mint sprigs, leaves picked</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>100ml white rum</li>
            <li>Sparkling water, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <head>Method</head>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Divide the raspberries, lime and sugar between two tall glasses and muddle 
                by gently crushing with a muddler or the end of a bar spoon. The fruits 
                should start to release their juices, which will mix with the sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put half the min leaves in the palm of one of your hands, the clap the other 
                hand on top of the leaves - this bruises them just enough to release their
                flavour. Drop the bruised mint leaves into one of the glasses, then repeat
                with the remaining mint, dropping it into the second glass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a handful of ice to each glass, followed by the rum. Stir then top up with 
                sparkling water. Stir briefly until just combined, then serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
